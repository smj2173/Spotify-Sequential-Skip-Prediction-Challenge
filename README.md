# Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction-Challenge

The Spotify streaming service hosts upwards of 400 million unique users each fiscal quarter, providing a platform for individuals to engage with millions of songs and curated content. The 2021 Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge arose out of a need to understand the quality of Spotify's personalized song recommendation system, and challenges participants to predict if a track in a user listening session will be skipped or not. Based on prior work, we hypothesize that metadata regarding user behavior and acoustic features are integral in understanding song skip behavior, and aim to use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gradient Boosting Tree models in order to accurately predict whether a user will skip a given song during their listening session. In this paper, our approach to predicting user song skip behavior using a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) baseline reached an accuracy level of 65\% and our Gradient Boosting Trees reach a performance of 66\%. An LSTM will also be implemented and its performance levels hopefully will be better than the baseline performance.
